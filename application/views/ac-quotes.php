								<div class="blog-content">
									<h2 class="quote-title">1. THE TYPE OF PARTS THAT ARE USED</h2>
									<p class="blog-desc"> The type of parts that are used can make a huge difference to the overall HVAC system. When looking for heating and AC repair, you should look for an HVAC company that uses reputable brands that are built to last rather than aftermarket parts. Reputable brands are often able to offer some type of warranty on their parts. This means that you’ll be covered should the parts fail prematurely or if anything should go wrong.</p>
									<p class="blog-desc"> In general, many HVAC companies and technicians will offer a guarantee on the parts as well, so you won’t have to go through the manufacturer. If anything goes wrong, all you have to do is give them a call and they’ll come fix the issue! </p>
									<p class="blog-desc"> If you’re installing SMART appliances, you can also expect a higher cost. Some HVAC contractors will automatically upgrade outdated appliances and parts with SMART ones. These parts may be more expensive; however, they’re a lot more energy efficient. You’ll end up saving money in the long run.</p>

									<h2 class="quote-title">2. THE TYPE OF UNIT THAT YOU ARE USING</h2>
									<p class="blog-desc"> If you are replacing an entire HVAC system and unit, the type of unit that you are installing can also have a huge effect on the total cost of the heating and AC repair. For example, if you are going with a high-end unit or if the contractor will be working on a high-end unit, they may charge you a lot more.</p>

									<h2 class="quote-title">3. WHETHER THE CONTACTOR OFFERS A GUARANTEE OR WARRANTY ON THEIR WORK</h2>
									<p class="blog-desc"> Although it’s surprising to some homeowners, warranties can impact the quote. Most HVAC companies will let you know what the manufacturer’s warranties are. These warranties will protect you from faulty equipment. As mentioned above, if you go with a more reputable brand, then you’ll likely have a better warranty. </p>
									<p class="blog-desc"> With that said, some HVAC technicians also offer additional guarantees for the installations as well. If any heating and AC repair is needed, you’ll be covered. Some HVAC companies will ask you if you want to purchase additional warranties from them. In these cases, you’re basically paying for insurance.</p>

									<h2 class="quote-title">4. THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT WILL BE WORKING ON THE PROJECT AND THE LENGTH OF TIME IT WILL TAKE FOR IT TO BE COMPLETED</h2>
									<p class="blog-desc"> Take a look at the labor costs that are quoted in the price. Consider the amount of people that will be working in your home, their hourly rates and what they’ll be working on. You should always confirm that everyone who is quoted in the price is needed and that the contractor isn’t hiring anyone who may be unnecessary for the job.</p>
									<p class="blog-desc"> Most quotes will include the amount of hours that the contractors expect the repair services to take. If you have several quotes, you can compare these hours to see whether what is being quoted is reasonable.</p>
									<p class="blog-desc"> If you need the repair work to be done by a certain time, this may also be reflected in a higher quote because the workers may need to work longer hours or they may need to bring in more people to get the job done. </p>

									<h2 class="quote-title">5. BREAKDOWN OF LOCAL AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS</h2>
									<p class="blog-desc"> Depending on the type of repair work that you’re getting done, this may be rather important. A good quote will also include the cost of permits and also provide some information on the potential fines that you may face if you break certain local or federal regulations. The technicians will be able to back up why they recommend certain repairs or parts with local or federal regulations that apply to you.</p>
								 
									<h2 class="quote-title">6. AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT YOUR BILLS WILL LOOK LIKE</h2>
									<p class="blog-desc"> This last bit might be a bit surprising, but almost every good HVAC company will also include a part in the quote that gives you a better idea of how your bills will look like after the repairs are completed or after the new installations are done. This part of the quote should also give you an analysis of what type of changes that you can expect to see in upcoming years. </p>
									<p class="blog-desc"> If you are installing a new, more energy-efficient HVAC system, you’ll definitely want to go over this part of the quote. A SEER rating of 16 could mean that you’ll save up to $400 a year on your energy bills. With time, the new installations practically pay for themselves over several years.</p>
									 
									<h2 class="quote-title">7. THE REPUTATION OF THE COMPANY</h2>
									<p class="blog-desc"> Many people prefer working with a reputable and experienced company because they are more likely to offer consistent work. They’re also generally more reliable. With that said, a high-end HVAC company may charge more for their name. They know that they deserve to charge a higher price because of all of the experience and expertise that they have and because of their reputation on the market.</p>
